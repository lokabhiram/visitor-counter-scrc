To run the visitor counter application continuously on a Raspberry Pi, you can create a systemd service that will start the application automatically on system boot and keep it running in the background. Here's how you can do it:

## 1. Create a systemd service file

Create a new file named `visitor-counter.service` in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/visitor-counter.service
```

Add the following content to the file:

```
[Unit]
Description=Visitor Counter Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/visitor-counter/main.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/visitor-counter
StandardOutput=inherit
StandardError=inherit
Restart=always
User=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

Replace `/path/to/main.py` with the actual path to your `main.py` file.

## 2. Enable and start the service

1. Reload the systemd daemon to pick up the new service file:

   ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

2. Enable the service to start automatically on system boot:

   ```
   sudo systemctl enable visitor-counter.service
   ```

3. Start the service:

   ```
   sudo systemctl start visitor-counter.service
   ```

4. Check the status of the service:

   ```
   sudo systemctl status visitor-counter.service
   ```

   You should see the service running.

## 3. Manage the service

Here are some common commands to manage the service:

- Start the service:
  ```
  sudo systemctl start visitor-counter.service
  ```
- Stop the service:
  ```
  sudo systemctl stop visitor-counter.service
  ```
- Restart the service:
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart visitor-counter.service
  ```
- Check the status of the service:
  ```
  sudo systemctl status visitor-counter.service
  ```
- View the logs of the service:
  ```
  sudo journalctl -u visitor-counter.service
  ```

With this systemd service, your visitor counter application will start automatically on system boot and run continuously in the background on your Raspberry Pi. If the application crashes or stops for any reason, the service will automatically restart it.
